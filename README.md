### What I learned

It's a great opportunity to learn the box in css and divs. Through doing this we'll get a basic idea about how to design a webapp using html and css

### Useful resources

- [MDN webdocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for understandting the css properties
- [Color converter](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp) - It's an amazing tool. I used to convert the colour from hsl to rgba
